Project name: Olivia'a 1st website
Project description: Teching the world to learn!
Describe the functionality: There are many notes, quotes, videos, tables and links to help teach you how to learn since you never really learned how to learn! All the resources are here!
Describe the technologies used:  We used tables, videos, and images to show you new ways of learning. We even added some animation to make it more fun!
Plans for finalizing the project: To finalize the project more, we'd like to fix some justifcation issues making them more semetrical. We want to add more resources and links for the consumer to continue learning. We'd also like to make all the images more relateable.
